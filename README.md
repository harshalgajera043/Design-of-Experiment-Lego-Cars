# Design of Experiment Lego Cars
This project centers on applying Design of Experiment (DOE) principles to optimize a Lego car's performance. By systematically varying factors like car length, load type, tire size, number of tires, and car height, the goal was to pinpoint the optimal parameter combination to maximize the Lego car's covered distance.

# Introduction
Design of Experiment is a potent methodology widely used across various fields to optimize processes and enhance outcomes. In this project, we applied DOE principles to refine the Lego car's performance, utilizing statistical tools, including Minitab, to identify key factors influencing its travel distance.

# Objective
The main project objective was to determine the optimal combination of factors resulting in the Lego car covering the maximum distance. This involved systematically varying selected parameters and using statistical analysis, particularly Minitab, to identify the most influential factors.

# Data
Factors considered for this experiment were:

1. Car length
2. Load type
3. Tire size
4. Number of tires
5. Car height

These factors were systematically manipulated to create a well-designed set of experiments.

# Minitab Implementation
In the realm of statistical analysis, Minitab, a robust and sophisticated software tool, played an indisputably pivotal role. The project's initial phase witnessed the creation of a one-half fraction experiment employing the sparsity of effects. Minitab facilitated the meticulous recording of the distance covered by the Lego car for each factor combination, followed by a meticulous analysis of the collected data, ultimately contributing to the creation of a predictive model.

The second phase, equally meticulous in its approach, involved Minitab's instrumental role in refining the model. This was achieved through the elimination of non-significant factors, a process grounded in a single experiment. This phase, characterized by an exhaustive and meticulous statistical analysis, enabled Minitab to identify and retain only those factors that significantly influenced the Lego car's travel distance. This meticulous step proved to be crucial in achieving the project's overarching goal - the creation of an optimized model with the highest accuracy in predicting the covered distance.

# Procedure
The experiment unfolded in two meticulously planned and executed phases. The initial phase entailed the creation of a one-half fraction experiment utilizing the sparsity of effects, whereby the Lego car's covered distance was meticulously recorded for each factor combination. The collected data underwent an extensive and meticulous analysis using Minitab to meticulously craft a predictive model.

The second phase, conducted with the same meticulous approach, witnessed the elimination of non-significant factors based on the model's analysis. This decision-making process, drawn from insights derived from a single experiment, led to only the most significant factors being considered. The ultimate goal was to create an optimized model that could predict the distance covered with the highest accuracy.

# Results and Discussion
The results of this intricate experiment, achieved through meticulous analysis using Minitab, unveiled the optimal combination of parameters that propelled the Lego car to cover the maximum distance. The ensuing discussion section, characterized by its meticulous examination, delves into the significance of each factor, meticulously scrutinizes the implications of the results, and meticulously explores potential applications for further optimization.

This meticulous project serves as an exemplary showcase of the efficacy of Design of Experiment in systematically enhancing a process, with Minitab emerging as an indispensable tool for statistical analysis and model refinement. It not only provides valuable insights into the myriad factors influencing the performance of the Lego car but also meticulously lays a robust foundation for future enhancements and explorations in this domain.
